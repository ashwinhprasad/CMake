- For using a custom library, create a directory for the library inside the source directory and create a includes directory for the custom library.
- The includes directory will contain the header file which will contain the method declarations.
- Anything outside the includes directory is like the source of the custom directory which will contain the definition for the methods in the header file
- In the main.cpp outside the library, you can import the header file and start using the methods.
- In the cmake file, you have to add the library and it's include directory. Once that is done, you also have to link the library to the project.
